Given an integer array arr. For each element in the array, check whether the right adjacent element (on the next immediate position) of the array is smaller. If the 
next element is smaller, update the current index to that element. If not, then update to -1.

Note: Update the array in itself.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
Output: [2, 1, -1, 3, -1]
Explanation: Array elements are 4, 2, 1, 5, 3. Next to 4 is 2 which is smaller, so we print 2. Next of 2 is 1 which is smaller,so we print 1. Next of 1 is 5 which is 
greater, so we print -1. Next of 5 is 3 which is smaller, so we print 3.  Note that for last element, output is always  going to be -1 because there is no element on 
right.


JAVA CODE:


// User function Template for Java

class Solution {
    public void immediateSmaller(int arr[]) {
        // code here
         int n = arr.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i + 1] < arr[i]) {
                arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
            } else {
                arr[i] = -1;
            }
        }
        arr[n - 1] = -1;
    }
}
